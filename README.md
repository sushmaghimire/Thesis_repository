# Eye-Tracking Analysis for Cyclist Visual Attention

This repository contains analysis scripts used to study cyclist gaze behavior under different environmental conditions using eye-tracking data.

### Contents

- **Path Fixation Analysis**: Calculates cyclist fixations within the riding path during both daytime and nighttime rides.
- **Headlamp Fixation Analysis**: Identifies and visualizes cyclist fixations that fall within the illuminated area of the headlamp during nighttime riding.
- **Day vs Night Path Comparison**: Compares visual fixation behavior between daytime and nighttime sessions across the defined cycling path.

Each script uses video-calibrated pixel coordinates and fixation datasets to extract and visualize meaningful metrics related to visual attention and safety.

**Note**: All datasets and measurements used are specific to the conducted experimental setup and may require adaptation for other contexts.
